        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is sunkanmi, i am a software engineer and Mechatronics Engineering undergraduate passionate about building technology that creates real impact. Right now, I’m working on an AI-powered subtitle generator for movies, blending my skills in software and AI to make media more accessible.
            My long-term mission is to tackle Africa’s largest challenges using software and robotics. I believe in combining innovation with community, which is why I’m also shaping initiatives like Hackers University — a movement designed to empower engineering students with the skills and labs to turn ideas into real products.
            With every project, I’m laying the foundation for building one of the world’s most valuable companies, rooted in Africa but designed for global impact.
